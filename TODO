self join/leave commands for queue.

CODE REFACTORING:
Redo Tree attack goals, and lumberMeleeAttackGoal
Better spongepowered config.
Input validation on wave mob chances (must add up to 1.0).
Make ConfigParser prettier. method try/cathc ijnstead of many of them?
Cloud framework
Remove all places where we check itemstack's material. Instead, compare directly with ItemUtil.item


FIXES:
todo: remove iron, ogld, etc. variables from lumberplayer. instead, work just with inventory. move the inventory calculation to the scoreboard method, and on inventory change just update scoreboard.

- Partigon tree particles
- Shop with NPC

Big todo:
 - Shop & Regular Items (1d)
 - Difficulty Scaling for players (CR higher) (3h). With debug command or /start parameter.

 - Classes & Class Shop (1d)
 - More customizable Mobs + More mobs (1d)
 - Partigon & Polish

 - Difficulty Selection (increases CR slightly, but mostly HP - SCALE variable). Maybe completely diff wave types?
 - Mob attacks & spells
 - Buildings & Towers?
