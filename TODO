self join/leave commands for queue.

CODE REFACTORING:
Redo Tree attack goals, and lumberMeleeAttackGoal
Better spongepowered config.
Input validation on wave mob chances (must add up to 1.0).
Make ConfigParser prettier. method try/cathc ijnstead of many of them?
Cloud framework
Remove all places where we check itemstack's material. Instead, compare directly with ItemUtil.item

+++ For more complex MobType, extend MobType for example CreeperMobType if need ot contrrol fuse speed


MOBS:
 - Armor & Equipment
 - IsBaby
 - Knockback resistance (for heavy creeper)






Big todo:
 - Shop & Regular Items (1d)
 - Difficulty Scaling for players (CR higher) (3h). With debug command or /start parameter.
 - Balancing for singleplayer
 - Player Death

 - Classes & Class Shop (1d)
 - More customizable Mobs + More mobs (1d)
 - Partigon & Polish

 - Difficulty Selection (increases CR slightly, but mostly HP - SCALE variable) [Post Hypixel]. Maybe completely diff wave types?
 - Mob attacks & spells [Post Hypixel]
 - Buildings & Towers? [Post Hypixel]
