self join/leave commands for queue.

CODE REFACTORING:
Use events but not in listeners package.
Redo Tree attack goals, and lumberMeleeAttackGoal
Better spongepowered config.
Input validation on wave mob chances (must add up to 1.0).
Make ConfigParser prettier. method try/cathc ijnstead of many of them?
Cloud framework
Remove all places where we check itemstack's material. Instead, compare directly with ItemUtil.item


FIXES:
Tree relog with NMS.
Fix skeleton arrow damage:
1) listen for EntityShootBowEvent. Set some metadata on arrows that were fired from specified bow.
2) Listen for EntityDamageByEntityEvent. If damager is arrow, then check if there is a metadata and if there is, then change damage.

Until TMRW:
- Partigon tree particles
- Shop with NPC
- Send Tree NMS packets every X seconds and upon relog?

Big todo:
 - Shop & Regular Items (1d)
 - Difficulty Scaling for players (CR higher) (3h). With debug command or /start parameter.
 - Balancing for singleplayer
 - Player Death

 - Classes & Class Shop (1d)
 - More customizable Mobs + More mobs (1d)
 - Partigon & Polish

 - Difficulty Selection (increases CR slightly, but mostly HP - SCALE variable) [Post Hypixel]. Maybe completely diff wave types?
 - Mob attacks & spells [Post Hypixel]
 - Buildings & Towers? [Post Hypixel]
