CODE REFACTORING:
Better spongepowered config.
Input validation on wave mob chances (must add up to 1.0).
Make ConfigParser prettier. method try/cathc ijnstead of many of them?
Cloud framework

Remove all places where we check itemstack's material. Instead, compare directly with ItemUtil.item
fix Id, Uuid, CR and NPC to all be id, uuid, npc, cr, getCr, getNpc, getUuid, getId





FEATURES:
Bomber drops TNT on death
Ranged Bomber (chucks TNT)
Partigon tree particles

Big todo:
 - Classes & Class Shop (1d)
 - More customizable Mobs + More mobs (1d)

Super backlog (QOL stuff):
- add healthbars to mobs
- player glow according to color
- different pitch for damage sounds?
- item magnetism
